                <p><strong>Review:</strong> This is a very good book. I recommend that everyone should read it at least once in their life. It portrays how the pain of losing someone is universal and does not spare anyone.The pain of losing someone close to us can be unbearable, and not everyone can process it maturely. When Chick Benetto loses his mother to a heart attack, he turns to alcohol. This is quickly followed by him abandoning his family and attempting suicide three times, all triggered by the pain of not being invited to his daughter's wedding.</p>

                <p><strong>Review:</strong>Dr Shashi Tharoor, the erudite and eloquent author of 16 earlier books, now takes up his pen to express his views on Hinduism. As he says in the introductory note to this book, his purpose is two-fold: to “understand… the extraordinary wisdom and virtues of the faith” and to “show the… intolerant and often violent forms of Hindutva…” According to the author himself, this book is targeted at the English-speaking twenty-first century reader.

The book is divided into three sections, each consisting of one or more chapters.

The first section is titled “My Hinduism” which contains four chapters. The first and second chapters generally cover the basic tenets and beliefs of the faith. Here are some representative extracts from the first chapter:</p>
